# Homomorphic Encryption Client-Server

## Overview

This project implements a **client-server application** using **homomorphic encryption** with the **TenSEAL** library. The client encrypts a numerical value using **CKKS encryption**, sends it to the server, and the server performs **homomorphic arithmetic operations** on the encrypted data without decryption. The result is then sent back to the client for decryption and display.

## Features

- **CKKS Homomorphic Encryption** for floating-point arithmetic.
- **Secure Client-Server Communication** using sockets.
- **GUI-Based Client** built with Tkinter for user interaction.
- **Supports Multiple Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Squaring, and Percentage calculations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **TenSEAL** (Homomorphic Encryption Library)
- **Socket Programming**
- **Tkinter** (GUI for Client)
- **Pickle** (Serialization)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the required dependencies.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install tenseal
```

## How to Run

### Start the Server

```bash
python server.py
```

### Start the Client

```bash
python client.py
```

## Usage

1. Open the client application.
2. Enter a numerical value in the input field.
3. Select an operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, percentage , division , fraction , Square).
4. The encrypted data is sent to the server, computed securely, and the encrypted result is returned.
5. The client decrypts the result and displays it.
