# A Secure Two-party Basic Arithmatic Evaluation System using Homomorphic Encryption #

## Overview ‚ú®

This project implements a **secure two-party basic arithmatic evaluation system** using **Homomorphic Encryption** with the use of **TenSEAL** library. We develop a **graphical user interface (GUI)** where a client can choose which operation it wants to perform on the server side with its dataset of items in a  secure way. The client encrypts its own dataset of items using any of the following schemes, i.e., **BGV encryption**, **Paillier encryption**,  **CKKS encryption**, and sendsthe result to the server end, and finally, the server  **homomorphically evaluates the desired operation** on the encrypted data without performing any decryption. The result is then sent back to the client where it can decrypt  and get back the required result.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è

- **BGV Homomorphic Encryption** for integer arithmetic operation.
- **Paillier Homomorphic Encryption** for only additive homomorphic arithmetic operation.
- **CKKS Homomorphic Encryption** for floating-point arithmetic operation.
- **Secure Client-Server Communication** using socket programming model.
- **GUI-Based Client Appication** is built with Tkinter for the user interaction.
- **Supports Multiple Operations**: *Addition*, *Subtraction*, *Multiplication*, *Division*, *Cube* , *Squaring* , and *Percentage* calculations.

## Technologies Used üöÄ

- **Python 3**
- **TenSEAL‚úÖ** (Homomorphic Encryption Library)
- **Socket Programming‚úÖ**
- **Tkinter‚úÖ** (GUI for Client)
- **Pickle‚úÖ** (Serialization)

**************** **Installation** ********************

#### Windows Environment ######

1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the required dependencies.

2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install tenseal
```

3. How to Run

### Start the Server

```bash
python server.py
```

### Start the Client

```bash
python client.py
```

#### Linux Environment ######

1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the required dependencies.

2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install tenseal
```

3. How to Run

### Start the Server

```bash
python server.py
```

### Start the Client

```bash
python client.py
```


## Usage

1. Open the client application.
2. Enter a numerical value in the input field.
3. Select an operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, percentage , division , fraction , Square).
4. The encrypted data is sent to the server, computed securely, and the encrypted result is returned.
5. The client decrypts the result and displays it.
