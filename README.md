# A Secure Two-party Basic Arithmatic Evaluation System using Homomorphic Encryption #

## Overview ‚ú®

This project implements a **secure two-party basic arithmatic evaluation system** using **Homomorphic Encryption** with the use of **TenSEAL** library. We develop a graphical user interface (GUI) where a client can choose which operation it wants to perform on the server side with its dataset of items in a  secure way. The client encrypts its own dataset of items using any of the following schemes, i.e., **BFV encryption**, **Paillier encryption**,  **CKKS encryption**, and send the result to the server end, and finally, the server  **homomorphically evaluates the desired operation** on the encrypted data without performing any decryption. The result is then sent back to the client where it can decrypt  and get back the required result.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è

- **BFV Homomorphic Encryption** for integer arithmetic operation.
- **Paillier Homomorphic Encryption** for only additive homomorphic arithmetic operation.
- **CKKS Homomorphic Encryption** for floating-point arithmetic operation.
- **Secure Client-Server Communication** using socket programming model.
- **GUI-Based Client Application** is built with Tkinter for the user interaction.
- Supports Multiple Operations: **Addition**, **Subtraction**, **Multiplication**, **Division**, **Cube**, **Squaring**, and **Percentage Calculations**.

## Technologies Used üöÄ

- **Python 3**
- **TenSEAL‚úÖ** (Homomorphic Encryption Library)
- **Socket Programming‚úÖ**
- **Tkinter‚úÖ** (GUI for Client)
- **Pickle‚úÖ** (Serialization)

## üîß Installation

### Windows Environment ######

1. Prerequisites
   - Ensure Python 3.13 is installed.

  - installed python -> https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install Dependencies

- install numpy

pip install numpy

- install tenseal

  pip install tenseal
  ```
 ##### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: socket, pickle, and tkinter are built-in with Python on Windows, so no need for separate installation.

3. Run the Application

### Start the Server

```bash
python3 server.py
```

### Start the Client

```bash
python3 client.py
```

### üêß Linux Environment

1. Prerequisites

 - Install Python 3.13
  ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install python3

   
 - Install Pip
     ```bash
    sudo apt update 
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    
   

2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install tenseal

3.Install Tkinter (if not pre-installed)
 ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk

4. How to Run

### Start the Server

```bash
python3 server.py
```

### Start the Client

```bash
python3 client.py
```


## Usage

1. Open the client application.
2. Enter a numerical value in the input field.
3. Select an operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, percentage , division , fraction , Square).
4. The encrypted data is sent to the server, computed securely, and the encrypted result is returned.
5. The client decrypts the result and displays it.
